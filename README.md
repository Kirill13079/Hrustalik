## Tech

Hrustalik uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [MonkeyCache](https://github.com/jamesmontemagno/monkey-cache) - Easily cache any data structure for a specific amount of time in any .NET application.
- [UserDialogs](https://github.com/aritchie/userdialogs) - A cross platform library that allows you to call for standard user dialogs from a core .net standard library.
- [SkiaSharp](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp) - SkiaSharp is a cross-platform 2D graphics API for .NET platforms based on Google's Skia Graphics Library.
- [PancakeView](https://github.com/sthewissen/Xamarin.Forms.PancakeView) - An extended ContentView for Xamarin.Forms with rounded corners, borders, shadows and more!
- [CardsView](https://github.com/AndreiMisiukevich/CardView) - Custom controls.
- [Skeleton](https://github.com/HorusSoftwareUY/Xamarin.Forms.Skeleton) - The new loading approach for cool apps in Xamarin Forms.
-  [Authentication](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore)

And of course Hrustalik itself is open source with a [public repository][dill] on GitHub.
